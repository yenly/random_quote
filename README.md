This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebookincubator/create-react-app).

This simple [Random Quote app](https://yenly.github.io/random_quote/) is an exercise on making a React app written in ES6 using Firebase database to serve up my collection of favorite quotes.
